# Spoofing or tampering token by injected DB

## Spoofing (подмена)
Most security systems rely on the identification and authentication of users. 
Spoofing attacks consist in using another user credentials without their 
knowledge. Typical spoofing threats target weak authentication mechanisms, for
instance those using simple passwords, like a simple 4 digits number, or those 
using personal information that can be easily found, like date or place of birth.

## Tampering (Фальсификация через вмешательство)
Only authorised users should be able to modify a system or the data it uses. 
If an attacker is able to tamper with it, it can have some consequences on the 
usage of the system itself, for instance if the attacker can add or remove some
functional elements, or on the purpose of the system, for instance if important 
data is destroyed or modified.
