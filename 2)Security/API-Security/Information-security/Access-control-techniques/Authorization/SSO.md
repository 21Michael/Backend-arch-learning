## Types of SSO:
  - **Federated Identity Management (FIM);**  
    SSO is actually a part of a larger concept called Federated Identity Management,
    thus sometimes SSO is referred to as federated SSO. FIM just refers to a trust 
    relationship that is created between two or more domains or identity management 
    systems. Single Sign-on is often a feature that is available within a FIM
    architecture.
  - **OAuth (specifically OAuth 2.0 nowadays);**  
    OAuth 2.0 is a specific framework that could also be considered part of a FIM 
    architecture. OAuth focuses on that trusted relationship allowing user identity 
    information to be shared across the domains.
  - **OpenID Connect (OIDC);**  
    Is an authentication layer that was built on top of OAuth 2.0 to provide Single Sign-on functionality.
  - **Security Access Markup Language (SAML);**  
    Is an open standard that is also designed to provide Single Sign-on functionality.
