# Publish / Async-Response 

The publish/async responses interaction style is a higher-level style of interaction thatâ€™s
implemented by combining elements of publish/subscribe and request/response. A cli-
ent publishes a message that specifies a reply channel header to a publish-subscribe
channel. A consumer writes a reply message containing a correlation id to the reply
channel. The client gathers the responses by using the correlation id to match the reply
messages with the request.
