# JSON:API

**JSON:API** is “a specification for building APIs in JSON,” Its original goal was
to create a communication model based around defined interactions, rather than 
leaning on per-application “ad-hoc” code. JSON:API sets a standard for communication;
it expresses how requests to the server should be formatted, and then what the 
response to the client should be formatted as. Its goal is to optimize HTTP requests
by reducing the number of requests needed as well as reducing the size of the 
packages themselves.
