# Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

**An Amazon ECR** private registry hosts your container images in a highly available and scalable 
architecture. You can use your private registry to manage private image repositories consisting of
Docker and Open Container Initiative (OCI) images and artifacts. Each AWS account is provided with 
a default private Amazon ECR registry.
